    <h2>Part of Londons best burrito</h2>
    <p>Back in October 2010 I decided to try and find what I felt was London's best burrito after noticing that there was quite a lot of choice. To make it a fair test I set the following rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>steak burrito</li>
        <li>no guacamole</li>
        <li>hot sauce</li>
        <li>to go (no knife and fork allowed)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How does this burrito ran in my quest? See my full list of what I feel are <a href="http://www.ross-eats.co.uk/london%E2%80%99s-best-burrito/">London's best burritos</a>.</p>
